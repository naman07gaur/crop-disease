# AgriHealthAnalyzer
# Crop Disease Detection and Prevention

This project is a Node.js and React-based application that detects crop diseases and provides information about their prevention using the Plant.id API. The application allows users to upload images of crops, which are then analyzed to assess their health.

## Features

- Upload images of crops for health assessment.
- Provides detailed information about detected diseases, including treatments and causes.
- User-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Uses multer for image upload handling.
- Implements Axios for API calls to the Plant.id health assessment service.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Image Upload**: Multer
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv
